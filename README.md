# EC601_MiniProject_1

## How to run our code?

## Vision/Goals of the project:
In this project, we want to know about what are the most welcome cities in the US for a short trip by implenmenting analysis of the tweets. We will give a list of cities ranked from the most positive to the most negative (or least positive) in the overall sentiment of all related text tweet content.

## Users/Customers:
The project can benefit anyone who currently has a plan of traveling or want to get information for certain traveling cities in the US. 

It can also provide information to traveling agencies like which cities are most and least welcome to help them design tourism products, for example, they can use this infomation in advertisement or arrange more trips to the most welcome cities.

## User Stories:

## Solutions:
Firstly, we "The 25 Best U.S. Cities to Spend a Weekend" updated by THRILLIST TRAVEL on 05/07/2019 (https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/best-us-cities-to-spend-a-weekend-nashville-austin-charleston-providence)

Then, we extracted the related tweets by setting up certain filters and keywords.
2. Output text content of the tweets as input for Google NLP.
3. Use Google NLP tools for the sentiment analysis.
4. Display analysis result in a top-down rank.
